# Payment Module Integration Rules

This document defines the contract and integration rules between the frontend app "cdk_front_payment" and the backend service "cdk_back_payment". It clarifies that the frontend strictly consumes capabilities exposed by the backend, and specifies the expectations, dependencies, endpoints, authentication, error handling, and versioning strategy.

## Scope

- Frontend: cdk front/cdk_front_payment
- Backend: cdk backend/cdk_back_payment
- Objective: Ensure cdk_front_payment uses only public, versioned interfaces exposed by cdk_back_payment, never internal/private APIs or shared mutable state.

## Source of Truth and Direction of Dependency

- The backend (cdk_back_payment) is the single source of truth for payment data, business rules, and side-effects with third-party providers (e.g., payment gateways).
- The frontend (cdk_front_payment) is a consumer that:
  - Initiates payment-related actions by calling backend HTTP endpoints.
  - Renders and manages client-side state derived from backend responses.
  - Never bypasses the backend for authoritative decisions (authorization, payment status, refunds, etc.).
- Any changes to domain shape or business logic start in the backend and are versioned. The frontend updates to consume the new versions.

## Networking and Contracts

- Protocol: HTTPS over REST JSON APIs.
- Content-Type: application/json for requests and responses unless noted otherwise.
- Timeouts: Frontend should enforce reasonable timeouts (e.g., 10–30s) and present retry UX where appropriate.
- Idempotency: For operations like "create payment" or "retry capture", the frontend should pass an Idempotency-Key header if supported; the backend must treat it correctly.

## Authentication and Authorization

- Frontend includes an Authorization: Bearer <JWT> header for all protected endpoints.
- JWT issuance/refresh flow is owned by the auth service; cdk_back_payment validates tokens and scopes/claims.
- Frontend must:
  - Handle 401 (unauthorized) by refreshing token or redirecting to login.
  - Handle 403 (forbidden) by informing the user of insufficient permissions.

## Versioning Policy

- All backend payment endpoints are prefixed with a version: /api/payment/v1/...
- Backwards-incompatible changes are introduced under a new version: /api/payment/v2/...
- Frontend pins to a specific version per release. Upgrades are explicit and tested.

## Environment Configuration

Frontend must not hardcode URLs. It reads environment-specific base URLs from configuration:

- Example variables:
  - PAYMENT_API_BASE_URL (e.g., https://api.example.com/api/payment/v1)
- The backend is responsible for exposing environment-specific endpoints and CORS settings to allow the frontend origin(s).

## Endpoint Catalog (illustrative)

Note: Final shapes must match cdk_back_payment implementation. The following contract describes the intended public surface. The backend owns the canonical OpenAPI; the frontend consumes it.

1) POST /api/payment/v1/payments
- Purpose: Create a new payment intent/order.
- Request body:
  {
    "amount": number,            // cents or smallest currency unit
    "currency": "string",        // ISO 4217
    "method": "string",          // e.g., "card", "pix", "boleto"
    "metadata": { "key": "val" } // optional
  }
- Response 201:
  {
    "id": "string",
    "status": "requires_action|processing|succeeded|failed",
    "clientSecret": "string",     // if client confirmation is needed
    "nextAction": { ... },        // provider-specific next-step info
    "createdAt": "ISO-8601"
  }
- Errors: 400 (validation), 401/403 (auth), 409 (duplicate/idempotency), 5xx.

2) POST /api/payment/v1/payments/{paymentId}/confirm
- Purpose: Confirm/authorize/capture as required by provider flow.
- Request body (optional, depending on method):
  {
    "paymentMethodData": { ... }  // device or provider artifacts
  }
- Response 200:
  {
    "id": "string",
    "status": "processing|succeeded|failed",
    "receiptUrl": "string|null",
    "providerRef": "string|null"
  }

3) GET /api/payment/v1/payments/{paymentId}
- Purpose: Retrieve a payment by id.
- Response 200:
  {
    "id": "string",
    "amount": number,
    "currency": "string",
    "status": "requires_action|processing|succeeded|failed|refunded",
    "createdAt": "ISO-8601",
    "updatedAt": "ISO-8601",
    "metadata": { ... }
  }

4) POST /api/payment/v1/payments/{paymentId}/refund
- Purpose: Refund a payment (full or partial).
- Request body:
  {
    "amount": number|null, // null for full
    "reason": "string|null"
  }
- Response 202:
  {
    "refundId": "string",
    "status": "pending|succeeded|failed"
  }

5) GET /api/payment/v1/methods
- Purpose: List available payment methods for the current user/account/region.
- Response 200:
  {
    "methods": [
      { "code": "card", "label": "Credit/Debit Card" },
      { "code": "pix", "label": "PIX" }
    ]
  }

The backend may provide more endpoints (webhooks, reconciliation), but only versioned, documented routes are considered public for the frontend.

## Error Model

- Response shape for errors:
  {
    "error": {
      "code": "string",           // machine-readable
      "message": "string",        // user-friendly fallback
      "details": { ... }          // optional, structured
    }
  }
- HTTP codes:
  - 400: ValidationError (frontend should validate preflight where possible).
  - 401: Unauthorized (trigger token refresh or login).
  - 403: Forbidden (insufficient permissions).
  - 404: NotFound (show not found or retry guidance).
  - 409: Conflict (idempotency or state mismatch).
  - 422: Unprocessable (business rule violated).
  - 429: TooManyRequests (throttle UX).
  - 5xx: ServerError (show retry, log, non-blocking fallback where safe).

Frontend rule: never assume success; always branch on HTTP code and, on non-2xx, read error.error.code to determine UX messaging and remediation.

## CORS and Security

- Backend must configure CORS to allow only the known frontend origins per environment.
- No wildcard Access-Control-Allow-Origin in production.
- Cookies (if used) are SameSite=strict/lax and Secure; tokens should be short-lived with refresh flows.
- Frontend must not store secrets; only tokens from auth flow are used.

## State Management and UI in the Frontend

- Frontend global state stores only data derived from backend responses (e.g., current payment, list of methods).
- All writes go through service layer functions that call backend endpoints.
- Example service functions:
  - paymentService.createPayment(request): Promise<CreatePaymentResponse>
  - paymentService.confirmPayment(paymentId, data): Promise<ConfirmResponse>
  - paymentService.getPayment(paymentId): Promise<Payment>
  - paymentService.refundPayment(paymentId, body): Promise<RefundResponse>
  - paymentService.listMethods(): Promise<MethodsResponse>
- UI components dispatch actions to thunks/sagas that use these services; they do not hardcode fetch logic inline.

## Logging, Observability, and Correlation

- Frontend must pass a correlation/request-id header if available (e.g., X-Request-ID). If not generated by the backend, frontend may generate a UUID per user action.
- Backend should echo correlation ID in responses and logs.
- Errors surfaced to the user should be accompanied by a short code that can be cross-referenced in backend logs.

## Idempotency and Retries

- For user-initiated payment submissions, frontend should include Idempotency-Key when retrying the same logical action to avoid duplicate charges.
- Backend ensures idempotent handling per key within a reasonable TTL.

## Webhooks (Backend-internal)

- Webhooks from payment providers are handled exclusively by the backend.
- Frontend never receives direct webhook calls.
- Backend updates payment status and exposes it via GET endpoints; the frontend polls or uses server-sent events/WebSocket if provided and documented under the same version.

## Performance and Rate Limits

- Backend may enforce rate limits; frontend should:
  - Debounce rapid user actions.
  - Handle 429 with exponential backoff and user feedback.
- Payload size should be minimal; avoid sending unnecessary metadata.

## Breaking Changes Procedure

- Backend introduces changes under a new version and updates OpenAPI.
- Frontend aligns to the new version, updates service layer types, and adjusts UI.
- The old version is deprecated with a communicated timeline; both versions may run in parallel during migration.

## Testing Expectations

- Backend provides contract tests and an OpenAPI spec.
- Frontend consumes the OpenAPI spec to generate types or validate requests and responses at build/test time.
- E2E tests validate the full flow:
  - Create payment -> confirm -> success receipt
  - Failure paths and retries
  - Refund paths where applicable

## Example Headers

- Required on protected requests:
  - Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
  - Content-Type: application/json
  - Accept: application/json
  - X-Request-ID: <uuid> (recommended)
  - Idempotency-Key: <uuid> (for create/confirm/refund as applicable)

## Clear Statement of Dependency

- cdk_front_payment depends on cdk_back_payment. The frontend must only use versioned, documented public endpoints of cdk_back_payment.
- cdk_back_payment does not depend on cdk_front_payment. It is designed to be consumed by multiple clients. Any UI-specific assumptions are invalid at the backend layer.

## Change Management

- Any change request that affects payload shapes, error codes, or flow must start with an update to the backend contract (OpenAPI), followed by:
  1) Backend implementation and deployment to non-prod.
  2) Frontend update to target new API version.
  3) Integration testing.
  4) Coordinated production rollout.# Payment Module Integration Rules
