# User Story: Company Management System

**As a user**, I want to create and manage companies with role-based permissions so that I can control access and maintain organizational structure.

## Core Requirements

### Company Creation
- I need to create a new company by providing essential details (company name, description, etc.)
- Upon successful creation, I should receive confirmation and be automatically assigned as an admin
- The system should validate required fields and prevent duplicate company names

### Company Viewing
- I must be able to view the company I created with all its current details
- The interface should clearly display my role (admin) and current members
- I should see company information in a clean, organized format

### Admin Privileges
- As the creator, I am automatically granted admin permissions
- Only users with admin role can modify company details (name, description, settings)
- Only admins can invite new members and assign/modify member roles
- The system should clearly indicate admin-only actions in the UI

### Member Management
- Admins can add other users as company members
- Admins can promote members to admin status or revoke admin privileges
- Non-admin members should have read-only access to company information
- The system should show a clear member list with roles

## Technical Considerations
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Include error handling for unauthorized actions
- Consider audit logging for admin actions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can successfully create a company
- [ ] Creator automatically becomes admin
- [ ] Company details are viewable after creation
- [ ] Only admins can edit company information
- [ ] Only admins can manage members
- [ ] Non-admin members cannot perform restricted actions
